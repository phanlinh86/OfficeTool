"""A module for managing media files with downloading, playback, recording, and screenshot capabilities.

This module defines the `Media` class, which provides a unified interface for handling various media operations.
It supports downloading media from URLs (e.g., YouTube videos), playing audio and video files, recording audio from
a microphone, capturing video from a webcam, and taking screenshots. The module is designed for ease of use in
media-related applications, with non-blocking playback and error handling.

Key Features:
    - Download media files from URLs using yt-dlp with MP4 output.
    - Play media files asynchronously using VLC with stop control.
    - Record audio (WAV) and video (AVI) with specified durations.
    - Capture screenshots as PNG images.
    - Configurable output directory and optional verbose logging.

Dependencies:
    - yt_dlp: For downloading media from online sources.
    - vlc: For media playback using the VLC library.
    - pyaudio: For recording audio from the microphone.
    - wave: For saving audio recordings in WAV format.
    - cv2: For video recording via OpenCV.
    - pyautogui: For capturing screenshots.
    - threading: For non-blocking media playback.
    - os: For file and directory management.
    - time: For timing operations and delays.

Classes:
    Media: The primary class for interacting with media functionalities.

Constants:
    None explicitly defined, but methods use internal defaults (e.g., output path "../output").

Usage Example:
    ```python
    from media import Media  # Assuming the file is named 'media.py'
    media = Media()
    # Download a video
    file_path = media.download("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example")
    # Play the downloaded file
    media.play(file_path)
    # Record 5 seconds of audio
    media.record_audio("output.wav", 5)
    # Record 5 seconds of video
    media.record_video("output.avi", 5)
    # Take a screenshot
    media.screenshot("capture.png")
    # Stop playback if needed
    media.stop_playback()
